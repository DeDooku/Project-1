# Project-1

This project is a program that takes a list of items purchased, then counts each item and makes a list of each item and how many times it was purchased.
The info is then displayed in one of three ways, a whole list, a single item, or a histogram.

 * I think I did a great job or writing clear and consise code that is easy to understand.
 * I believe I could've enhanced my code by using python to handle user input, but I was more familiar with C++ and prefer using C++ for user input.
 * The hardest part for me was refreshing myself on how python works, particurally the syntax. However, it was pretty easy to just take a look at my python textbook to get a refresher.
 * I think learning how to pair two languages together will be great for my other projects, and the experience I've gathered with functions will be great for my course work.
 * I made the program readable and adaptable by using clear naming conventions and consise comments. The comments tell what each line or section of code achieves.
